This program is in C#.
This program lets you read your browser's setting.
You need 1 Librairy for that.
1) CredentialManagement

To install this libray you can use Nuget Package manager console.
Type this command in your VS console
Install-Package CredentialManagment

Optional---
I'm using 
Install-Package Costura.Fody
because it embeds all your dll file in the exe.
